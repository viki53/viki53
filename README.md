- I am a freelance Web developer and quality & delivery consultant from France
- I’m also ~~playing~~ building some small tools to make browsing the web easier, such as a notification browser extension for [@zestedesavoir](https://github.com/zestedesavoir), a few custom user styles, and some UX/accessibility audits
- During the day I build some webapps, working on all aspects (UX, frontend, backend and infra) and helping teams of great people
- During the night I try to make my house self-sufficient (permaculture, solar panels…)
- During my spare time I aim to build a new genaration social network that respects its users and is managed democratically
- I’m also aiming to learn new CSS techniques and Web stuff every day
- I’m looking to collaborate on helpful social/environmental projects. Hit me up! 👋
- Pronouns: he/him
