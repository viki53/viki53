- I'm a (previously freelance) Web developer and quality consultant from France (on the Brittany side) since 2011
- I’m currently working on making some small tools to make browsing the web easier, such as a notification browser extension for [@zestedesavoir](https://github.com/zestedesavoir), a few custom user styles, and some UX/accessibility audits
- I’m also aiming to learn new CSS techniques and Web stuff every day
- I’m looking to collaborate on helpful social/environmental projects. Hit me up! 👋
- Pronouns: he/him
