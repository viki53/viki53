### Hi! 👋

- I'm a freelance Web developer and quality consultant from France (on the Brittany side) since 2011
- I’m currently working on making some small tools to make browsing the web easier, such as a notification browser extension, a few custom user styles, and some UX/accessibility audits
- I’m also aiming to learn new CSS techniques and Web stuff every day
- I’m looking to collaborate on helpful social/environmental projects. Hit me up! 👋
- You can reach me at _contact_@_corentin-hatte.eu_ or _https://twitter.com/viki53_
