- I am a Web developer (previously freelance, from 2011 to 2021) and quality consultant from France
- I’m currently ~~playing~~ building some small tools to make browsing the web easier, such as a notification browser extension for [@zestedesavoir](https://github.com/zestedesavoir), a few custom user styles, and some UX/accessibility audits
- During the day I build some webapps, working on all aspects (UX, frontend, backend and infra) and managing a team of great people
- I’m also aiming to learn new CSS techniques and Web stuff every day
- I’m looking to collaborate on helpful social/environmental projects. Hit me up! 👋
- Pronouns: he/him
