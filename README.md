- I am a Web developer (freelance, from 2011 to 2021, and 2024+) and quality consultant from France
- Iâ€™m also ~~playing~~ building some small tools to make browsing the web easier, such as a notification browser extension for [@zestedesavoir](https://github.com/zestedesavoir), a few custom user styles, and some UX/accessibility audits
- During the day I build some webapps, working on all aspects (UX, frontend, backend and infra) and helping teams of great people
- During the night I try to make my house self-sufficient (permaculture, solar panelsâ€¦)
- Iâ€™m also aiming to learn new CSS techniques and Web stuff every day
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on helpful social/environmental projects. Hit me up! ðŸ‘‹
- Pronouns: he/him
